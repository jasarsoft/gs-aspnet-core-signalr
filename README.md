## Getting Started with ASP.NET Core SignalR
### by Roland Guijt

Real-time web functionality is almost a must when developing a web app nowadays. In this course, you will not only learn how the real-time web works, but also how to implement it using the greatest real-time web framework available. First, you will explore real-time web in general and about the low-level transports SignalR uses: WebSockets, Server Sent Events (SSE) and long polling. Next, you will learn about the SignalR concepts, and the ways SignalR uses the underlying transports to do Remote Prodecure Call (RPC) by utilizing Hubs. You'll also see what the differences are with earlier versions and what the challenges are when scaling out. Finally, you'll discover how to implement an example application step by step and you'll see how to deploy it to Azure. We're also taking a look at the security features. When you're done watching this course, you'll understand when SignalR is a good choice for problems you are tasked with solving.
